This dwm 6.3 (8b48e30, 2022-04-26) side project has a different take on dwm patching. It uses preprocessor directives to decide whether or not to include a patch during build time. Essentially this means that this build, for better or worse, contains both the patched _and_ the original code. The aim being that you can select which patches to include and the build will contain that code and nothing more. Due to the complexity of some of the patches dwm-flexipatch has diverged from mainstream dwm by making some core patches non-optional for maintenance reasons. For the classic dwm-flexipatch build refer to branch [dwm-flexipatch-1.0](https://github.com/bakkeby/dwm-flexipatch/tree/dwm-flexipatch-1.0).

For example to include the `alpha` patch then you would only need to flip this setting from 0 to 1 in [patches.h](https://github.com/bakkeby/dwm-flexipatch/blob/master/patches.def.h):
```c
#define BAR_ALPHA_PATCH 1
```

So if you have ever been curious about trying out dwm, but have been discouraged by manual patching, then this may be a good starting point to see what a "fully fledged" dwm can look like. Want to try out the `pertag` patch? Just flip a config and recompile. Once you have found out what works for you and what doesn't then you should be in a better position to choose patches should you want to start patching from scratch.

Alternatively if you have found the patches you want, but don't want the rest of the flexipatch entanglement on your plate then you may want to have a look at [flexipatch-finalizer](https://github.com/bakkeby/flexipatch-finalizer); a custom pre-processor tool that removes all the unused flexipatch code leaving you with a build that contains the patches you selected.

Refer to [https://dwm.suckless.org/](https://dwm.suckless.org/) for details on the dwm window manager, how to install it and how it works.

In order to reduce complexity when it comes to maintainance future versions of dwm-flexipatch may diverge from this by making some patches non-optional. For the classic dwm-flexipatch and its many patch integration hints refer to branch [dwm-flexipatch-1.0](https://github.com/bakkeby/dwm-flexipatch/tree/dwm-flexipatch-1.0) which will be subject to bug fixes and mainstream dwm updates as far as feasible.

   - [anybar](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/anybar/)
      - enables dwm to manage external status bars such as lemonbar and polybar
      - dwm treats the external bar as it would its own, so all regular dwm commands such as
        togglebar affect the external bar in the same way

   - [aspectresize](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/aspectresize/)
      - allows windows to be resized with its aspect ratio remaining constant

   - [attachabove](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/attachabove/)

      - new windows are placed at the bottom of the stack

   - [autoresize](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/autoresize/)
      - by default, windows that are not visible when requesting a resize/move will not get
        resized/moved, with this patch, however, they will

   - [autostart](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/autostart/)
      - makes dwm run `~/.dwm/autostart_blocking.sh` and `~/.dwm/autostart.sh &` on startup

   - [awesomebar](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/awesomebar/)
      - enhanced taskbar that allows focus / hiding / unhiding of windows by clicking on the status
        bar

   - [bar_border](https://codemadness.org/paste/dwm-border-bar.patch)
      - adds a border around the bar similarly to how client windows have borders

   - [bar_height](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/bar_height/)
      - allows the bar height to be explicitly set rather than being derived from font

   - [barmodules](https://github.com/bakkeby/patches/wiki/barmodules/)
      - splits the dwm bar into modules allowing for re-arrangement of the bar and easier
        integration for new features

   - [barpadding](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/barpadding/)
      - adds vertical and horizontal space between the statusbar and the edge of the screen

      - adds an iscentered rule to automatically center clients on the current monitor

   - [cfacts](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/cfacts/)
      - the cfacts patch provides the ability to assign different weights to clients in their
        respective stack in tiled layout

   - [clientindicators](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/clientindicators/)
      - draws a dot indicator overlayed on each tag icon for each client
      - the selected client is drawn as a larger horizontal line

   - [cmdcustomize](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/cmdcustomize/)
      - allows color attributes to be set through the command line

   - [colorbar](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/colorbar/)
      - lets you change the foreground and background color of every statusbar element

   - color_emoji
      - enables color emoji in dmenu by removing a workaround for a BadLength error in the Xft
        library when color glyphs are used
      - enabling this will crash dwm on encountering such glyphs unless you also have an updated
        Xft library that can handle them

   - [combo](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/combo/)
      - allows you to select multiple tags by pressing all the right keys as a combo, e.g. hold MOD
        and press and hold 1 and 3 together to view those two tags

   - [cool_autostart](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/cool_autostart/)
      - allows dwm to execute commands from an array in the config.h file

      - lets you cycle through all your layouts

   - [decoration_hints](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/decoration_hints/)
      - make dwm respect \_MOTIF\_WM\_HINTS property, and not draw borders around windows
       requesting for it
      - some applications use this property to notify window managers to not draw window
        decorations
      - not respecting this property leads to issues with applications that draw their own borders,
        like chromium (with "Use system title bar and borders" turned off) or vlc in fullscreen mode

   - [distributetags](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/reorganizetags/)
      - this reorganisetags variant re-distributes all clients on the current monitor evenly across
        all tags

   - [dmenumatchtop](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/dmenumatchtop)
      - updates the position of dmenu to match that of the bar
      - i.e. if topbar is 0 then dmenu will appear at the bottom and if 1 then dmenu will appear at
        the top

   - [dragcfact](https://github.com/bakkeby/patches/wiki/dragcfact/)
      - lets you resize clients' size (i.e. modify cfact) by holding modkey + shift + right-click
        and dragging the mouse

   - [dragmfact](https://github.com/bakkeby/patches/wiki/dragmfact/)
      - lets you resize the split in layouts (i.e. modify mfact) by holding the modkey + shift
        + left-click and dragging the mouse
      - this is a bespoke patch that supports vertical and horizontal layout splits as well as
        centered master variants

   - [dwmblocks](https://gist.github.com/danbyl/54f7c1d57fc6507242a95b71c3d8fdea)
      - signal integration to use dwm with a patched [dwmblocks](https://github.com/torrinfail/dwmblocks)
      - combined with the statuscmd patch this gives a clickable statusbar

   - [dwmc](http://dwm.suckless.org/patches/dwmc/)
      - a simple dwmc client using a fork of fsignal to communicate with dwm

   - [emptyview](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/emptyview/)
      - allows no tag at all to be selected
      - dwm will start with no tag selected and when a client with no tag rule is started and no
        tag is selected then it will be opened on the first tag

   - [ewmhtags](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/ewmhtags/)
      - adds EWMH support for \_NET_NUMBER_OF_DESKTOPS, \_NET_CURRENT_DESKTOP, \_NET_DESKTOP_NAMES
        and \_NET_DESKTOP_VIEWPORT, which allows for compatibility with other bars and programs
        that request workspace information, e.g. polybar's xworkspaces module

   - [exresize](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/exresize/)
      - this patch allows the user to change size and placement of floating windows using only the
        keyboard
      - it also allows for temporary vertical and horizontal extension of windows similar to other
        WMs fill command

   - [~extrabar~](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/extrabar/)
      - ~enables an extra status bar in dwm in a similar manner to the dualstatus patch~
      - ~if the primary status is at the top via topbar then the extra status bar will be placed at
        the bottom and vice versa~

   - extrastatus
      - formerly extrabar - now only splits the status into to statuses by using a status separator

   - [fakefullscreen](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/fakefullscreen/)
      - only allow clients to "fullscreen" into the space currently given to them
      - as an example, this will allow you to view a fullscreen video in your browser on one half
        of the screen, while having the other half available for other tasks

   - [fakefullscreenclient](https://github.com/bakkeby/patches/wiki/fakefullscreenclient/)
      - similarly to the fakefullscreen patch this patch only allows clients to "fullscreen" into
        the space currently given to them
      - as an example, this will allow you to view a fullscreen video in your browser on one half
        of the screen, while having the other half available for other tasks
      - the "twist" with this patch is that fake fullscreen can be toggled on a per client basis
        rather than applying to all clients globally

   - [fancybar](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/fancybar/)
      - shows the titles of all visible windows in the status bar

   - flexwintitle
      - based on the bartabgroups patch, this is a layout aware barmodules module for handling
        window titles intended to be used with flextile-deluxe

   - [~floatbordercolor~](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/float_border_color/)
      - ~this patch allows a different border color to be chosen for floating windows~

   - [floatpos](https://github.com/bakkeby/patches/wiki/floatpos/)
      - adds a float rule allowing the size and position of floating windows to be specified
      - control the size and position of floating windows similar to exresize, moveresize,
        moveplace patches
      - specify size and position using absolute, relative or fixed co-ordinates or
      - position floating windows in a grid-like manner

   - [focusadjacenttag](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/focusadjacenttag/)
      - provides the ability to focus the tag on the immediate left or right of the currently
        focused tag
      - it also allows to send the focused window either on the left or the right tag

   - [focusdir](https://github.com/bakkeby/patches/wiki/focusdir)
      - allows focusing on clients based on direction (up, down, left, right) instead of client
        order

   - [focusmaster](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/focusmaster/)
      - a simple patch that just puts focus back to the master client

   - [focusonclick](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/focusonclick/)
      - this patch makes you switch focus only by mouse click and not sloppy (focus follows mouse
        pointer)

   - [focusonnetactive](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/focusonnetactive/)
      - by default, dwm responds to \_NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW client messages by setting the urgency bit
        on the named window
      - this patch activates the window instead

   - [focusurgent](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/focusurgent/)
      - adds a keyboard shortcut to select the next window having the urgent flag regardless of the
        tag it is on

   - [fsignal](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/fsignal/)
      - send "fake signals" to dwm for handling, using xsetroot
      - this will not conflict with the status bar, which also is managed using xsetroot

   - [fullscreen](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/fullscreen/)
      - applies the monocle layout with the focused client on top and hides the bar
      - when pressed again it shows the bar and restores the layout that was active before going
        fullscreen

   - [hidevacanttags](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/hide_vacant_tags/)
      - prevents dwm from drawing tags with no clients (i.e. vacant) on the bar

   - [holdbar](http://dwm.suckless.org/patches/holdbar/)
      - with this patch dwm's built-in status bar is only shown when HOLDKEY is pressed
      - additionally the bar will now overlay the display

   - [ignore-xft-errors-when-drawing-text](https://groups.google.com/forum/m/#!topic/wmii/7bncCahYIww)
      - sometimes dwm crashes when it cannot render some glyphs in window titles (usually emoji)
      - this patch is essentially a hack to ignore any errors when drawing text on the status bar
        and may be removed if a more appropriate solution comes up

   - [inplacerotate](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/inplacerotate/)
      - allows rotation of all clients in the master or stack area without affecting the other area

   - [insets](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/insets/)
      - lets custom insets from each edge of the screen to be defined
      - an example use case would be to make space for an external bar

   - [ipc](https://github.com/mihirlad55/dwm-ipc)
      - implements inter-process communication through a UNIX socket for dwm
      - allows for the window manager to be queried for information, e.g. listen for events such as
        tag or layout changes, as well as send commands to control the window manager via other
        programs

   - [\_IS\_FLOATING](https://github.com/bakkeby/dwm-flexipatch/issues/50)
      - adds the \_IS\_FLOATING xproperty for floating windows
      - this can allow for a compositor to handle floating windows differently to tiled windows,
        e.g. only show shadows on floating windows
      - this patch is enabled via the ewmhtags patch

   - [ispermanent](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/ispermanent/)
      - adds rule option for clients to avoid accidental termination by killclient for sticky
        windows

   - [keymodes](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/keymodes/)

   - [~leftlayout~](http://dwm.suckless.org/patches/leftlayout/)
      - ~moves the layout symbol in the status bar to the left hand side~

   - LG3D
      - changes the window manager name to "LG3d" instead of "dwm" as a workaround for Java
        applications that assume that the window manager is using window reparenting
      - refer to the ISSUES secton of the dwm man page for more details

   - [losefullscreen](https://github.com/bakkeby/patches/wiki/losefullscreen/)
      - by default in dwm it is possible to make an application fullscreen, then use the focusstack
        keybindings to focus on other windows beneath the current window
      - it is also possible to spawn new windows (e.g. a terminal) that end up getting focus while
        the previous window remains in fullscreen
      - this patch ensures that in such scenarios the previous window loses fullscreen

   - [maximize](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/maximize/)
      - adds helper functions for maximizing, horizontally and vertically, floating windows using
        keybindings

   - [monitorrules](https://github.com/bakkeby/patches/wiki/monitorrules/)
      - adds rules per monitor, e.g. have default layouts per monitor
      - the use case for this is if the second monitor is vertical (i.e. rotated) then you may want
        to use a different default layout for this monitor than what is used for the main monitor
        (for example normal vertical split for main monitor and horizontal split for the second)

   - [monoclesymbol](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/monoclesymbol/)

      - removes the border when there is only one window visible

   - [nodmenu](https://git.suckless.org/sites/commit/ed68e3629de4ef2ca2d3f8893a79fb570b4c0cbc.html)
      - enable modifying dmenu in config.def.h which resulted previously in a compilation error
        because two lines of code hardcode dmenu into dwm
      - allows complete removal of dmenu, should you want to do that
      - NB: this patch was removed from the patches listing on the suckless page due to it's simplicity

   - nomodbuttons
      - allows for toggleable client button bindings that have no modifiers
      - this can, for example, allow you to move or resize using the mouse alone without holding
        down a modifier key, which can be practical if you have extra buttons on your mouse

   - [no_transparent_borders](https://github.com/szatanjl/dwm/commit/1529909466206016f2101457bbf37c67195714c8)
      - when terminals have transparency then their borders also become transparent
      - this patch ensures that borders have no transparency
      - note that this patch is only relevant if you are not using the alpha patch

   - [on\_empty\_keys](https://github.com/bakkeby/dwm-flexipatch/issues/51)
      - port of InstantVM's on_empty_keys functionality allowing keybindings that apply only when a

        launch firefox

   - [onlyquitonempty](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/onlyquitonempty/)
      - makes it so dwm will only exit via quit() if no windows are open (in order to prevent
        accidental loss of work)

      - adds simple markup for status messages using pango markup

   - [pertag](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/pertag/)

        now be on tag 1, 2, and 3

   - [resizecorners](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/resizecorners/)
      - by default, windows only resize from the bottom right corner
      - with this patch the mouse is warped to the nearest corner and you resize from there

   - [resizepoint](https://github.com/bakkeby/patches/wiki/resizepoint/)
      - practically the same as resizecorners, but the cursor does not warp to any of the window
        corners

      - closing the xclock window restores the terminal window in the current position

   - [swapfocus](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/swapfocus/)
      - this patch depends on the pertag patch and makes it possible to switch focus with a single

   - [systray](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/systray/)
      - adds system tray in the status bar

   - [tab](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/tab/)
      - transforms the monocle layout into a "tabbed" layout if more than one window is present on
        the monocle view
      - this is essentially just a specific bar
      - the patch has been added for demonstration purposes only and has limited compatibility with
        other patches
      - it will conflict space-wise with a second bar
      - note that fancybar, awesomebar, bartabgroups and similar patches make the tab patch
        redundant

      - toggle layout using the same keyboard shortcuts to set the layout
      - e.g. hitting `MOD+m` switches to monocle layout, hitting the same keybinding again brings
        you back to the previous layout

   - [transfer](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/transfer/)
      - lets you transfer the currently focused client between the master and stack area while
        increasing or decreasing the master area (nmaster) accordingly

   - [transferall](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/transfer/)

      - warps the mouse cursor to the center of the currently focused window or screen when the
        mouse cursor is (a) on a different screen or (b) on top of a different window

      - adds the window icon next to the window title in the bar

   - [windowrolerule](https://github.com/bakkeby/patches/wiki/windowrolerule/)
      - sometimes a single application opens different windows depending on the task at hand and
        this is often reflected in the WM_WINDOW_ROLE(STRING) x property
      - this patch adds the role field to the rule configuration so that one can differentiate
        between, say, Firefox "browser" vs "Preferences" vs "Manager" or Google-chrome "browser"

# tiagoprn's custom dwm-flexipatch build

## INSTRUCTIONS
- Edit **only** the files with the `*.def.h` extension. The `.h` only files hold a copy of the previous configuration, and are not versioned.
- After finished editing, run `build.sh`. **This will override the `.h` files** with the new (versioned) content.

This dwm 6.2 (5e34b2, 2020-06-11) side project has a different take on dwm patching. It uses preprocessor directives to decide whether or not to include a patch during build time. Essentially this means that this build, for better or worse, contains both the patched _and_ the original code. The aim being that you can select which patches to include and the build will contain that code and nothing more.

For example to include the `alpha` patch then you would only need to flip this setting from 0 to 1 in [patches.h](https://github.com/bakkeby/dwm-flexipatch/blob/master/patches.def.h):
```c
#define ALPHA_PATCH 1
```

So if you have ever been curious about trying out dwm, but have been discouraged by manual patching, then this may be a good starting point to see what a "fully fledged" dwm can look like. Want to try out the `pertag` patch? Just flip a config and recompile. Once you have found out what works for you and what doesn't then you should be in a better position to choose patches should you want to start patching from scratch.

Alternatively if you have found the patches you want, but don't want the rest of the flexipatch entanglement on your plate then you may want to have a look at [flexipatch-finalizer](https://github.com/bakkeby/flexipatch-finalizer); a custom pre-processor tool that removes all the unused flexipatch code leaving you with a build that contains the patches you selected.

Refer to [https://dwm.suckless.org/](https://dwm.suckless.org/) for details on the dwm window manager, how to install it and how it works.

      - dwm will start with no tag selected and when a client with no tag rule is started and no tag is selected then it will be opened on the first tag

   - [ewmhtags](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/ewmhtags/)
      - adds EWMH support for \_NET_NUMBER_OF_DESKTOPS, \_NET_CURRENT_DESKTOP, \_NET_DESKTOP_NAMES and \_NET_DESKTOP_VIEWPORT, which allows for compatibility with other bars and programs that request workspace information, e.g. polybar's xworkspaces module

   - [exresize](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/exresize/)
      - this patch allows the user to change size and placement of floating windows using only the keyboard
      - it also allows for temporary vertical and horizontal extension of windows similar to other WMs fill command

   - [extrabar](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/extrabar/)
      - enables an extra status bar in dwm in a similar manner to the dualstatus patch
      - if the primary status is at the top via topbar then the extra status bar will be placed at the bottom and vice versa

   - [fakefullscreen](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/fakefullscreen/)
      - only allow clients to "fullscreen" into the space currently given to them
      - as an example, this will allow you to view a fullscreen video in your browser on one half of the screen, while having the other half available for other tasks

   - [fakefullscreenclient](https://github.com/bakkeby/patches/blob/master/dwm/dwm-fakefullscreenclient-6.2.diff)
      - similarly to the fakefullscreen patch this patch only allows clients to "fullscreen" into the space currently given to them
      - as an example, this will allow you to view a fullscreen video in your browser on one half of the screen, while having the other half available for other tasks
      - the "twist" with this patch is that fake fullscreen can be toggled on a per client basis rather than applying to all clients globally

   - [fancybar](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/fancybar/)
      - shows the titles of all visible windows in the status bar

   - [floatbordercolor](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/float_border_color/)
      - this patch allows a different border color to be chosen for floating windows

   - [focusadjacenttag](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/focusadjacenttag/)
      - provides the ability to focus the tag on the immediate left or right of the currently focused tag
      - it also allows to send the focused window either on the left or the right tag

   - [focusonclick](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/focusonclick/)
      - this patch makes you switch focus only by mouse click and not sloppy (focus follows mouse pointer)

   - [focusonnetactive](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/focusonnetactive/)
      - by default, dwm responds to \_NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW client messages by setting the urgency bit on the named window
      - this patch activates the window instead

   - [focusurgent](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/focusurgent/)
      - adds a keyboard shortcut to select the next window having the urgent flag regardless of the tag it is on

   - [fsignal](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/fsignal/)
      - send "fake signals" to dwm for handling, using xsetroot
      - this will not conflict with the status bar, which also is managed using xsetroot

   - [fullscreen](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/fullscreen/)
      - applies the monocle layout with the focused client on top and hides the bar
      - when pressed again it shows the bar and restores the layout that was active before going fullscreen

   - [hidevacanttags](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/hide_vacant_tags/)
      - prevents dwm from drawing tags with no clients (i.e. vacant) on the bar

   - [holdbar](http://dwm.suckless.org/patches/holdbar/)
      - with this patch dwm's built-in status bar is only shown when HOLDKEY is pressed
      - additionally the bar will now overlay the display

   - [ignore-xft-errors-when-drawing-text](https://groups.google.com/forum/m/#!topic/wmii/7bncCahYIww)
      - sometimes dwm crashes when it cannot render some glyphs in window titles (usually emoji)
      - this patch is essentially a hack to ignore any errors when drawing text on the status bar and may be removed if a more appropriate solution comes up

   - [inplacerotate](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/inplacerotate/)
      - allows rotation of all clients in the master or stack area without affecting the other area

   - [ispermanent](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/ispermanent/)
      - adds rule option for clients to avoid accidental termination by killclient for sticky windows

   - [keymodes](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/keymodes/)

   - [losefullscreen](https://github.com/bakkeby/patches/tree/master/dwm/dwm-losefullscreen-6.2.diff)
      - by default in dwm it is possible to make an application fullscreen, then use the focusstack keybindings to focus on other windows beneath the current window
      - it is also possible to spawn new windows (e.g. a terminal) that end up getting focus while the previous window remains in fullscreen
      - this patch ensures that in such scenarios the previous window loses fullscreen

   - [maximize](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/maximize/)
      - adds helper functions for maximizing, horizontally and vertically, floating windows using keybindings

   - [mdpcontrol](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/mpdcontrol/)
      - adds keyboard bindings to control MDP (Music Player Daemon)

   - [monitorrules](https://github.com/bakkeby/patches/blob/master/dwm/dwm-monitorrules-6.2.diff)
      - adds rules per monitor, e.g. have default layouts per monitor
      - the use case for this is if the second monitor is vertical (i.e. rotated) then you may want to use a different default layout for this monitor than what is used for the main monitor (for example normal vertical split for main monitor and horizontal split for the second)

   - [monoclesymbol](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/monoclesymbol/)
      - always display the the monocle-symbol as defined in config.h if the monocle-layout is activated
      - do not display the number of open clients in the current tag

      - allows complete removal of dmenu, should you want to do that

   - [no_transparent_borders](https://github.com/szatanjl/dwm/commit/1529909466206016f2101457bbf37c67195714c8)
      - when terminals have transparency then their borders also become transparent
      - this patch ensures that borders have no transparency
      - note that this patch is only relevant if you are not using the alpha patch

   - [onlyquitonempty](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/onlyquitonempty/)
      - makes it so dwm will only exit via quit() if no windows are open (in order to prevent accidental loss of work)
